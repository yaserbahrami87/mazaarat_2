            <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-center border-bottom">2023</h3>
            <p>Visiting the sacred burial grounds of the pillars of society, great members of community and society's prominent religious figures, alongside paying homage and honoring their memory to receive spiritual blessing has always had a significant place in all religious cultures across the world, and in Islam specifically. It is indeed a presence which provides the basis for connecting to God's all-embracing mercy, as well as purifying one's soul and psyche. </p>
            <p>As of now, the most magnificent architectural works of the Islamic world are those that belong to the mausoleas and burials of Islam's eminent religious figures, a fact which in turn, manifests the chief notion of making pilgrimage to such locations. </p>
            <p>Given the crucial role the Islamic figures' mausoleas play in expanding the intercultural connections and carrying out the cultural development of the Islamic world, saving the spiritual heritage and Islamic holy pilgrimage sites, Astan Guds Razavi's Art Institution of Afarineshha has decided to hold the second Mazaarat International Photo Festival. </p>
            <p>Throughout this event, the experience and perseverence of all photographers will be attentively seeked, thus opening new horizons towards recording the glorious moments of prayer in addition to the magnificent instances of architecture.</p>
